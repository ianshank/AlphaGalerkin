## [0.2.0] - 2026-01-26

### Milestones Achieved

- **Zero-Shot Transfer Validated**: Physics PoC demonstrated resolution-independence
  - Trained on 9x9 grids, achieved MSE 0.000209 on 19x19 grids (240x better than 0.05 threshold)
  - Validates core Galerkin approach for continuous operator learning

- **Training Pipeline Operational**: End-to-end training with self-play working on GPU
  - MCTS-based self-play generates training experiences
  - LBB stability monitoring integrated into training loop

### Added

- **W&B Integration for Physics PoC**
  - `--wandb` flag for `train_physics.py` to enable Weights & Biases logging
  - Logs training loss, evaluation MSE, transfer MSE, and learning rate
  - Final summary includes success status and best transfer MSE

- **GameInterface Protocol Implementation**
  - Added `apply_action()` method to `SimpleGoGame` class
  - Enables MCTS integration with Go game state

- **Security Tests** (`tests/security/`)
  - Input sanitization tests for GTP interface
  - DoS protection via input length limits

- **E2E Tests** (`tests/e2e/`)
  - CLI journey tests for help and train commands

### Changed

- Replaced Unicode checkmarks with ASCII `[PASS]`/`[FAIL]` for Windows compatibility
- Updated `.gitignore` with additional patterns:
  - `nul` (Windows device file)
  - `*.log`, `*.dist-info/`
  - `hydra_outputs/`

### Fixed

- Fixed `AttributeError: 'SimpleGoGame' object has no attribute 'apply_action'`
- Fixed unused loop variable warning in `BoardSizeBatchSampler`
- Fixed line length issue in W&B initialization
